# Contributing to GoodOldMap
## I. Roles
   - Product Owner: Nina Xiao
   - Scrum Master: Tracy Zhang

## II. Team Values
  - Team members collaborate by interacting on our Discord and WeChat group chats, evaluating one another's work on Github, and monitoring each other's advancements through Standups.
  - If team members encounter challenges or disputes, they should raise these concerns during daily standups to the product owner and scrum master. These leaders assist the team in devising solutions. We anticipate that team members will reply to messages within a maximum of 2-3 hours.

## III. Daily StandUp
  Our regular StandUp schedule: **Tue/Thu 2pm EST, Friday 2pm EST**. 

  Should there be any changes to the above schedule such as time change or additional standups, scrum master is to be informed no less than 24 hours in-advance, otherwise the regular meeting schedule will be honored.

   During daily standup meetings, every member needs to answer three questions:
   - What have you done since last time?
   - What are you doing now?
   - Is there anything blocking your progress?
     
Scrum master records every member's progress and problems (answers to the above three questions) and post them on the daily standup channel on Discord.
